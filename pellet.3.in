.SH NAME
pellet \- Postfix Enhanced LDAP Lookup E-mail Translator

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pellet

.SH DESCRIPTION
pellet is a small python script, which acts as a tcp lookup table for postfix.
It was developed for using LDAP lookups (with smtpd_sender_login_maps) without
the need to have full e-mail addresses in attributes.

What pellet actually does, is taking a request ('get <sender address>') and
querying for associated LDAP entries.
Depending on your configuration it then tries to combine attributes returned
by the LDAP query in order to receive the original login e-mail addresses.
These are returned to postfix.

As an example, imagine you have a sender like 'user@example.net', but you don't
have this address in your LDAP tree, but rather something like
uid=user,dc=example,dc=net,ou=domains,dc=example,dc=com
If this user would be logged in as 'user@example.net', the regular LDAP table
lookups could only return 'user', which could not be mapped by the sender
restrictions.
pellet now enables you to not only resolve the correct e-mail address, but can
also handle aliases (like having the logged in user 'user@example.net' sending
a message as 'webmaster@example.com')!

.SH CONFIGURATION
In order to make pellet work, you need to make sure, postfix will spawn pellet
as a sub-process on start-up.
Therefore enter in your postfix' master.cf file the following line:
127.0.0.1:PELLET_PORT inet  n       n       n       -       0      spawn
    user=PELLET_USER argv=PELLET_LIB_DIR/pellet.py

Once started, pellet will look for the configuration file
PELLET_ETC_DIR/pellet.conf
You can just copy pellet.conf.dist and change the configuration options.
Following configuration options are available:

.SS [ldap] server
This configuration option determines the LDAP server, where the queries go to.
Enter your server either per URI (e.g. ldap.example.net) or its IP address.
Default: 127.0.0.1

.SS [ldap] port
Here you can set the port to connect to when connecting to the LDAP server.
Default: 389

.SS [ldap] scheme
Set the scheme to be used for LDAP connections.
You can use regular 'ldap', encrypted 'ldaps' (remember to check certificates)
or 'ldapi' when connecting via socket.
Possible values: ldap, ldaps, ldapi
Default: ldap

.SS [bind] dn
Here you can set the DN to use for binds.
If no DN is given, pellet will try to use an anonymous connection.
Default: none

.SS [bind] pw
If you need to authenticate while binding to the bind DN, use this password.
If you configured unauthenticated binds, you can just leave it empty.
Default: none

.SS [query] base
This is the base DN for your LDAP queries. Set it to the part of the DIT
where you want to start your search.
You can use placeholders in your base DN:
%u will be replaced by the user part of the sender address
%n will be replaced by the whole sender address
%d will be replaced by the domain part of the sender address
%d1 (and %d2..%d9 respectively) will be replaced by the single domain parts
%% will be replaced by %
Example user@example.com: %u = 'user'; %n = 'user@example.com';
%d = 'example.com'; %d1 = 'example'; %d2 = 'com'
This option is mandatory!

.SS [query] filter
This option lets you define a standard LDAP filter for your queries.
The same placeholders as with the base DN are available.
Default: (objectClass=*)

.SS [query] scope
You can set the search scope for your query here.
'base' will look at the same level of the base DN, 'one' will look at one
level below the base DN, 'sub' will search the whole subtree.
Possible values: base, one, sub
Default: base

.SS [query] deref
With this option you can tell your query, whether to dereference aliases or
not. Use 'never' to never follow references, 'search' to follow during
search operations, 'find' to follow only at finding and 'always' to always
follow. Remember to match your filter!
Possible values: never, search, find, always
Default: never

.SS [query] attrs
This option lets you define, which attributes to return from in your LDAP
query. Set at least your user part attribute (e.g. 'uid', see
[result] attr_local) and, if memberOf domain resolution is used, the
'memberOf' attribute.
Example: attrs = 'uid', 'memberOf'
If no attributes are set, the standard set is returned.
Default: none

.SS [result] attr_local
Name your LDAP attribute here, which holds your e-mail user part.
For a dn like 'uid=user,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com' you would like to use
'uid'
Default: uid

.SS [result] attr_domain
You can define, which LDAP attribute holds the domain part(s) of the
resolved e-mail address. Don't worry, if example.com is split into
'dc=example,dc=com'; pellet will manage it for you, if you set the
attribute to 'dc'.
The DN will be searched from left to right for these attributes.
Default: dc

.SS [result] domain_by
Here you can choose, how your domain is resolved.
You could either set it to 'dn' in order to scan the returned DNs for
your domain attribute (see [result] attr_domain), to 'memberof', if
you store domain relationships through groups (remember to get the
'memberOf' attribute from LDAP, see [query] attrs) or to 'fixed', if
a single domain should be appended for every user part (see
[result] domain_fixed).
Possible values: dn, memberof, fixed
Default: dn

.SS [result] domain_fixed
If you set [result] domain_by to the value of 'fixed', you need to
provide the domain here, which will be appended to all found user
attributes.
This option is mandatory, if domain_by is set to 'fixed'.
Default: none

.SS [result] non_dpart
Here you can configure, how the search for domain attributes handles
attributes, which don't correspond to [result] attr_domain.
You can either ignore/'skip' these, or break up the search.
Example: [result] attr_domain is 'dc' and [result] domain_by is 'dn':
With a dn like uid=user,dc=mail,dc=net,ou=sub,dc=example,dc=com
'skip' would return 'user@mail.net.example.com' whereas
'break' would return 'user@mail.net'.
If you only have the domain parts on root level, you might just not
care.
Possible values: break, skip
Default: break

.SS [alias] get_aliased
If you use aliases also for e-mail aliases, this might be of interest.
Setting this option to 'on' allows you to start an extra query for
each returned alias in order to retrieve the aliased object.
Base DN is the DN of the returned alias, scope is 'base' and deref is
'always' by default for these queries.
Possible values: on, off
Default: off

.SS [alias] alias_filter
If you use the alias dereferencing (see [alias] get_aliased), you
can set your filter for the alias queries here.
So you might want to search for everybody with uid=%u in the first
query, but when it comes to alias resolution, you might only want
back results with an explicit object class. Use this option for
such a purpose.
Default: (objectClass=*)
